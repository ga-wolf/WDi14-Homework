// The Final Exercise
//
// This is really, really difficult, and we don't really expect it to get done. But worth having a think about!
//
// Eventually we want five console.logs that look like the following...
//
// Groucho Marx was born in 1890.
// Chico Marx was born in 1887.
// Zeppo Marx was born in 1901.
// Harpo Marx was born in 1888.
// Gummo Marx was born in 1892.
// You'll need to rearrange the data firstly, then alter the data, then print it out.
